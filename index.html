        <h3>Awareness Campaigns and Activism</h3>
        <article>

            <ul class="job-description">
                <li>Tahir promotes opensource education and technologies. He initiated Opensource Literate Pakistan to
                    aware and to educate people regarding potential, possibilities, and opportunities of opensource.
                    He conducted opensource and Google Summer of Code awareness sessions with Azad Chaiwala, Junaid
                    Ansari, Carla Riechman, Saad Hamid, Amineshwar Kaur, Rayanul Kabir, Stateviews.pk, Muhammad Ali
                    Rajper, Muhammad Iqbal Trainer, Radio FM 101 Mirpur, and Scholarship Network Community.


                </li>
                <li>Tahir is the petitioner of public interest litigation in Islamabad High Court (Tahir Ramzan versus
                    Federation of Pakistan and others - Writ Petition # 399/2020) against intellectual dishonesty,
                    record tampering, and data manipulation in Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication
                    and its projects. Tahir pointed out irregularities, incompetencies, and corrupt practices in the
                    Prime Minister’s Pakistan Citizen Portal and the Virtual University of Pakistan: <a

                    </a></li>

                <li>In early 2017, Tahir led an awareness campaign regarding cryptocurrencies and their misuse, which
                    was a scam to fool the public. This campaign prompted the Deputy Inspector General of Police and
                    Commissioner Mirpur Division to release a press advisory statement based upon his campaign.
                    Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan did the same. Later that turned out
                    a multi-billion global scam: <a

                    </a></li>

                <li>Tahir initiated a campaign about “ATM Card Swipe Swindle” in 2016. Where he achieved success in
                    generating awareness concerning this fraud, which affected the majority of ATM card users in
                    restaurants and fast-food outlets, his work included alerting the authorities since the public could
                    be manipulated, and the potential for misuse of ATM cards was high.
                </li>
                <li>Tahir also initiated and successfully led a campaign for his university students called “Protest
                    against Discrimination in Prime Minister’s Laptop Scheme” in 2014. The outcome of this campaign was
                    that his university received quota in the scheme for its students. Along with his fellows, he has
                    proven how a peaceful protest can be successful through intellectual dialog. This campaign took 18
                    months of continuous struggle and hard work, which included social media awareness, print media
                    press coverage, and communication with higher authorities and the government.

        <h3>About Tahir</h3>
        <article>

            <p>Coming from a family with an unfortunate financial situation, Tahir has been working since his childhood.
                He has had many different types of work experiences, including working as an office boy, laborer,
                electrician, and supporting staff and tutor as well as spending time as a volunteer.
                He left his kindergarten school after passing level 02 in 1999, going on to work with his father in a
                college canteen in 2002 as a support-worker. In 2003 he left that college canteen and started another.
                Where the principal of the college offered him free education; the college classes were 03 years higher
                than his current educational level. That principal left the college within a year, so Tahir finalized
                his study after passing level 06. In 2006, he was admitted as a private/non-regular candidate in the
                examination of level 09 and 10 and passed. After that, he worked in varying capacities in different
                places as he needed to leave often to make time for his studies and exams. He gained a one-year
                vocational Electrical Certificate in 2007 and a one-year vocational Electrician Certificate in 2008. He
                passed levels 11 and 12 in 2009 as a private/non-regular student while working with lawyers as part of
                their support staff. He then gained admission to an e-learning and distance university, the Virtual
                University of Pakistan, where he graduated with dual bachelor degrees in BSIT and BSCS. He studied MSCS
                and worked on his research project “Teaching of Mathematics using IT”; the theme of the project is
                “Future Technologies in E-learning and Distance Education.”
                Tahir is a two times Google Summer of Code student. GSOC is a prestigious program for the best student
                programmers across the world, where participating mentoring organizations select a few top proposals out
                of thousands. He developed refunds and partial payments extension and APIs for CiviCRM. CiviCRM is a
                constituency relationship management used by many large NGOs, including Amnesty International, Creative
                Commons, the Free Software Foundation, CERN, and the Wikimedia Foundation for their fundraising. He
                implemented Apache HTTPD connector for libModSec (aka ModSec v3). ModSecurity is an open-source web
                application firewall, a toolkit for real-time web application monitoring, logging, and access control.
                He was Android Students Club Facilitator and Organizer in 2015, where he was required to teach and train
                club members about mobile application development; Google-funded ASC and they selected just a few
                proposals to launch and run this community.
                The use of information communication and mobile technologies for development is his core research
                interest, particularly the use of ICT for the education of kindergarten children who are not in school
                as well as within the agricultural sector where farmers are under-privileged and living below the
                poverty line. He aims to empower them and to provide real meaning and practical use for ICT amongst
                people where it has had no positive or productive use until now.
                His focus is on localized and context-aware human-computer interaction as per sociological,
                psychological, and pedagogical aspects. His future goal is to dedicate himself to teaching and the
                education of oppressed children, women, and farmers. He believes in creating the two-subject curriculum;
                literacy (local language, the national language, and foreign language) and mathematics (problem-solving,
                critical thinking, and analytical reasoning) because they have less time and resources to get involved
                in more courses. Their education needs to be blended using technology, e-learning, and distance
                education.
                He believes that sustainable development is dependent on education and growing awareness between
                children, women, and farmers. He loves teaching, training, collaboration, volunteer, research, and
                development opportunities. He thinks problems are possibilities to make new meaning for the future, and
                today is the future. He is an advocate of human rights, the economics of education, the industry of
                knowledge, and open-source paradigm; feel free to ping him if something which lies within.
